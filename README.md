My activities consist of different codes to perform the responsive website and also have documentation.

This activity is all about my different logos. The pages of my activity consist of WORK, ABOUT, BLOG, and CONTACT.

When you click "Work," you will see all the logos; when you click "About," you will see short information about myself; when you click "BLOG," you will see the post that I created; and when you click "CONTACT," you will see the information that you will put in your name, email, subject, enter your text here, and the submit button to message me.
